3. **Steam ID:** You can get your 64-bit Steam id (SteamID64 - 17 digit number) by clicking on your profile name in the top right corner in steam desktop client, select "Account Details" and your Steam ID will be displayed directly under your account name

## Update README
1. Add below comment in your markdown file for Steam User Stats
	```md
	<!-- Steam-Stats start -->
	<!-- Steam-Stats end -->
	```
2. Add below comment for Steam Workshop Stats (Optional)
	```md
	<!-- Steam-Workshop start -->
	<!-- Steam-Workshop end -->
	```
3. Don't forget to add these comments in your readme file or wherever you want to display your steam stats, because without the comments the readme will not get updated

> [!CAUTION]
> The `Steam-Stats` marker should be placed before the `Steam-Workshop` markers if you are using both.
