> ### From one Passionate Gamer and Developer to Another üçª

## Prerequisites
1. **Steam Web API Key:** API key is important to fetch your account details and for that you will require a key which you can create for your account [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev)
2. **Github API Token:**
	1. Goto your Github profile -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens -> Tokens(Classic) or just click [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
	2. Generate new token -> Generate new token(classic)
	3. Select scopes -> repo and workflow only
	4. Set a reasonable expiration date

## Samples (From my [Steam Account](https://steamcommunity.com/id/nicconike/))
**Example for Steam User Stats**
<!-- Steam-Stats start -->
![Steam Summary](https://github.com/nicconike/steam-stats/blob/master/assets/steam_summary.png)
<div class='recently-played-games'><p>No games played recently</p></div>
<!-- Steam-Stats end -->

**Example for Steam Workshop Stats**
<!-- Steam-Workshop start -->
![Steam Workshop Stats](https://github.com/nicconike/steam-stats/blob/master/assets/steam_workshop_stats.png)
<!-- Steam-Workshop end -->

## Update README
1. Add below comment in your markdown file for Steam User Stats
	```md
	<!-- Steam-Stats start -->
	<!-- Steam-Stats end -->
	```
2. Add below comment for Steam Workshop Stats (Optional)
	```md
	<!-- Steam-Workshop start -->
	<!-- Steam-Workshop end -->
	```
3. Don't forget to add these comments in your readme file or wherever you want to display your steam stats, because without the comments the readme will not get updated

## Setup with Example
After completing the steps mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites), you have to save all the mentioned keys(except markdown comments) like Github Token,API Key, Steam-ID, Custom-ID as Secrets in your Github repo's settings.

> Repo Settings -> Security -> Secrets and Variables -> Actions -> Add in Repository Secrets

If you are new to **Github Secrets** then you can checkout this doc [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions). And from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication) you can learn about **Github Tokens**.

**Sample Workflow File**
