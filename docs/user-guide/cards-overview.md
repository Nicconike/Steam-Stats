## Troubleshooting Card Display :material-auto-fix:

If a card is missing, verify the corresponding action input:

- Missing User Summary :material-arrow-right-bold-outline: Check `STEAM_API_KEY` and `STEAM_ID`
- Missing Recent Games :material-arrow-right-bold-outline: Check playtime data exists or disable log scale
- Missing Workshop :material-arrow-right-bold-outline: Ensure `WORKSHOP_STATS: True` and valid `CUSTOM_STEAM_ID`

For deeper troubleshooting, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](../user-guide/troubleshooting.md).
